This folder contains the Joins: To be more specific the Inner join, Left Join and the Full outer join.
But because MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN I hace opted to do a union of a left join and Right join

Write a query to find the total number of bookings made by each user, using the COUNT function and GROUP BY clause.

Use a window function (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) to rank properties based on the total number of bookings they have received.
